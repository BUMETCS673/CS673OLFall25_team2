### Stacey Burns

My name is Stacey, and I work as an SDET. I am pursuing the Graduate Certificate in Software Engineering and hope to further my education with my Master's degree next year. I think I got hooked to the idea of becoming a developer the first time I debugged something successfully.
When I'm not working or in school, I enjoy spending time with my family and trying to figure out how to keep my plants alive.
