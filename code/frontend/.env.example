# Example environment variables for the frontend
# Copy this file to .env (NOT committed) and adjust as needed.

# Backend API base URL (include /api if your backend is mounted there)
# Production / staging (HTTPS proxy or backend)
# Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-proxy.onrender.com/api
# DO NOT leave this pointing to an http:// host when deploying the static site over HTTPS, or browsers will block requests.
# Legacy direct backend (HTTP only) example kept for reference:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://54.227.173.227/api
# For local development uncomment the following instead:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api

# Any other future variables:
# VITE_FEATURE_FLAG_X=true
